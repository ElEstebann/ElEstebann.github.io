description1: This gamejam game was created over the course of 3 days with fellow UCI students. It is a game of golf where a die is used instead of a golfball. Due to time restraints, many planned additional features remained unimplemented. This was the first time making a game in Unreal Engine for most team members.
description2: Most of my work on this game was on the plpayer controller. I created a player controller for shooting the die in a given direction and could change die types. I also implemented interactions with golf holes and hazards.
