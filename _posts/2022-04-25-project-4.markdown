description1: This game was created for a gamejam involving students from several California college campuses. In 48 hours, we created a laser puzzle game where the player must push mirrors and lasers in order to hit a target to proceed to the next area.
description2: I implemented the core gameplay of using pushable objects and a reflectable laser to solve puzzle rooms. All audio elements were implemented into the game by me.
