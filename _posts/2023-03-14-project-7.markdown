description1: Zot Racer was a game that I pitched for the VGDC Winter Game Showcase. I assembled a team of 8 programmers and designers who all wanted further experience with Unreal Engine 5.
description2: As the team lead, I managed the source control for our project by creating a Perforce server using a dedicated Linux server in my apartment. I also  created a omnidirectional track design tool, implemented UI elements, implemented visual effects, and implemented most of the sound assets.
description3: Since the goal of this project was to gain experience with Unreal Engine, I helped team members learn the engine by being a resource for them to learn from. I answered questions on how to navigate the Unreal Editor and I found documentation for important classes and functions team members might need. I also became more familiar with the engine through this project.
