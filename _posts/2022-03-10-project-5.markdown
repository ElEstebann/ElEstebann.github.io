description: Acid Trip 4 was a quarterly project that had diffuculty getting off the ground. The team originally began work in Fall of 2021, but I wasn't brought on until the beginning of 2022. Without a dedicated producer, the team struggled to get much done during the quarter. 

During my time on the team, I lead a team of 10 students to actualize all of the game's goals. I set healthy and achievable goals for the team to pursue each week and displayed progress about the game in a mix of Google Spreadsheets and Trello boards. Since the large team had issues meeting all at the same time, I mediated ideas over multiple team meetings to ensure all team members understood the direction of the game. 

While most of my work on this game was in producing it, I also contributed to the game by importing and polishing UI assets and animations. I integrated the existing dialogue system to accomodate changing sprites and sound effects.
