description1: I was the sole programmer on this 1 week gamejam game. In this game, 4 players or AI opponents fight in a deadly game of dodgeball. A player must take out all of their opponents by throwing the jack-o-lantern at them. Once a player is out, they can possess nearby objects to disrupt the game by interrupting players' throws. When a player is knocked out, all of the players they have knocked out are brought back alive.  
description2: Over this week, I wrote a flexible player controller configured for multiplayer and AI. I also implemented all sound and battle UI elements. I honestly put a bit too more time into battle text animations, but I really liked how they ended up. Overall I spent a healthy amount of time on this gamejam and got everything we planned implemented.
