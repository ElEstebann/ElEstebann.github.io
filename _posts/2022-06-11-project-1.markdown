description1: This is a game made for GDIM 61 - Introduction to Game Development done over 8 weeks. With a team of 12, we created a task management game where a ghost must tidy-up a home without being seen by it's homeowners. 
description2: I worked on the UI elements of this game. I created scripts to create indicators pointing to important tasks and the navigable menus. All sound was also implemented by me.
